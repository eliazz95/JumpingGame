# Jumping Game
## My first pygame ever!

So this is my first ever made pygame were I tried to replicate the dinosaur game that is in the chrome browser. 
I think I made a fairly good job! However, the enemy spawning could be improved as well as a couple of other things. But as a first game I should be satisfied as this point.

I started following a tutorial on youtube on how to make a pygame. Of course, I tweeked the making to my liking so it would be more of a challenge than to just copy everything from the tutorial. The youtube channel is called Tech with Tim and you can click the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6xMBig-pP4&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lp3jAExUCewBfMx3UZFkh5) for the tutorial.

Perhaps I will make a second iteration of the game and improve some stuff.

## Instructions

Pretty straightforward, just jump using space button and try to avoid the enemies! The speed of the enemies will increase with every 2000 score, so it gets very hard very fast!

## Run in Gitpod

You can compile and run my game in Gitpod which is a free online dev environment for Github, pretty neat!
Just click the button below and you should be directed to the game.
